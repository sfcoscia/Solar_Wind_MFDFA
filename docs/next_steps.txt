Singularity Spectrum 

Test multiple hurst parameters

What we are looking at: 

We always use FFT for solar wind and assume stationarity 
We may find nonstationarity 
DO we see a change in the multifractality - is it reasonable to assume
stationarity - what is our translation

How far outside the stationarity regime can we get and still have reasonable
estimations from FFT methods that assume stationarity?

TEST THE ALFVEN RADIUS/ALFVEN SURFACE

Look at a few different places along the solar wind trajectory to see if we have
different spectral and multifractal characteristics.
 - If so, what does that mean? 

------------------------------------------------------
NEXT STEPS:

Ransac - Use to fit a bunch of lines
- Find the best biggest line segments you can
- Look at Histogram of the differences of each fit 

Calculate the Singularity Spectrum 

Test a few different Hurst Parameters using FGN code

Test some things we know aren't fractal - take favorite statistical model
- Laser time sequence

- Autoregressive fits
