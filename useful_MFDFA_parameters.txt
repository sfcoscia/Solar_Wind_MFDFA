The purpose of this text file is to describe a few quantities of interest that
can be calculated from MFDFA. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asymmetry parameter : Determines how the multifractal spectrum is skewed. 

	A = (alpha_max - alpha_0) / (alpha_0 - alpha_min),
	where alpha_max is the maximum value of alpha at the base of the 
	concave graph, alpha_min is the minimum value of alpha at the base
 	of the concave graph, and alpha_0 is the alpha value where the MF
	spectrum is at a maximum.

For A = 1 the spectrum is symmetric.

For A > 1 the spectrum is right-skewed symmetric (has a long right tail).

	- This indicates that the spectrum has greater contributions from small
	  fluctuations.

For A < 1 the spectrum is left-skewed symmetric (has a long left tail)

	- This indicates that the spectrum has greater contributions from large
	  fluctuations.

R^2 Coefficient : Can be used to determine how linear the Renyi exponent
spectrum.
